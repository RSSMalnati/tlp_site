Anish: TEP program gives lot of flexibility of learning here at Citi. Everyone here is really helpful and give you opportunities to develop and grow. My manager also volunteered me to contribute to rebranding of Citi's auction site and also had been working on the Angular integration with the Drupal Content Management System. There is good exposure to senior leadership and strong bonding with TEP family.
